# Movie Recommender ERD Diagram Analysis

## Current Diagram Overview

The current Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the Movie Recommender application includes:

1. **auth_user table** - Core user information table with standard Django user fields:
   - id (PK)
   - password
   - last_login
   - is_superuser
   - username
   - email
   - date_joined

2. **users_favoritemovie table** - Association table for user favorite movies:
   - id (PK)
   - user_id (FK to auth_user)
   - movie_id (external reference to TMDb movie)
   - created_at (timestamp)

3. **Relationships**:
   - One-to-many relationship between auth_user and users_favoritemovie
   - The diagram shows a relationship between users_favoritemovie and "TMDb API"

## Diagram Assessment

### Strengths
- The diagram clearly shows the user authentication table and favorite movies relationship
- It represents the basic data structure of the application
- It shows the relationship between users and their favorite movies

### Limitations

1. **TMDb API Representation**:
   - The diagram incorrectly represents TMDb API as if it were a database entity/table
   - In reality, TMDb API is an external service, not part of the database schema
   - The movie_id in users_favoritemovie references TMDb's movie IDs, but these aren't stored locally as a table

2. **Incomplete Visualization**:
   - The ERD doesn't fully represent the caching mechanism mentioned in Database_schema.md
   - It doesn't show any temporary data structures that might exist in the application
